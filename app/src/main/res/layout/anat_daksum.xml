The surrounding forests are famous for fauna and flora.This famous tourist sport is in the south east of Anantnag town and is about a distance of 40 kilometers from district headquarter.The place is famous and attractive due to an ancient spring surrounded by a garden terraced and developed by the Mughals.Perhaps the most beautiful of springs is Achabal, which gushes out of the Sosanwar hill.The upper portion of the garden is called 'Bag-e-Begum Abad' developed by Malika Noor Jehan Begum in 1620 AD and renowned as Sahib Abad."
